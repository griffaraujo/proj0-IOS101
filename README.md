An app that I would like to build would be an app that can return recipes based on what you have and restrictions. 
The app will ask you for what ingredients and cookware that you have access to as well as any dietary restrictions or
allergies. The app will then tell you what you can make with that in mind. I want the app to be able to try and adapt
to what the people have and don't.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
